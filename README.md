Generate and tweak statistical models of nanoparticle binding and internalization to cancer cells over time from in vivo imaging in R.
Use the data to infer relationships: i) identify whether targeted nanoparticles increase internalization into cancer cells over time; ii) identify whether there exist temporal relationships between the various phases of nanoparticle ‘states’, i.e., between ‘free’ nanoparticles in tumor interstitium, nanoparticles bound to the surface of tumor cells, and nanoparticles internalized into tumor cells. This work may require first estimating biasing or otherwise convoluting parameters and removing them from consideration.
